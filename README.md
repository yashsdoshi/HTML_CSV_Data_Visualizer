# :octocat: Visualise your CSV data via `chart.js` on static HTML

<hr />

I've tried to keep things simple as much possible for simplicity!

This website made using,

1. <b>`HTML`</b> 
2. <b>`chart.js`</b>


# Note from Owner
- [x] <b>I have not worked much on `styling` for simplicity.</b>
- [x] <b>This website will give you a clear understanding of how `chart.js` works!</b>
